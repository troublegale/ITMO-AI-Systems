# Lab 2. Knowledge-based decision-making system
Usage: `go run aisystems-lab2 <location/name.pl>`

Use `help query` to see query options.

Use `help param` to see query parameter options.

**NOTE:** you can use `param` and `!param` in the same query, but multiple usages of the same parameter will be overwritten by the last one.

There were slight changes to the `dungeons.pl` file due to code simplification.
