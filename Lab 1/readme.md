# Lab 1. Knowledge bases and ontologies

## Part 1. Creating a knowledge base and executing queries in Prolog

The subject area chosen for the lab work is the role-playing board game Dungeons & Dragons. The knoledge base is described in `dungeons.pl`. Quries are listed in `queries.pl`.

## Part 2. Creating an ontology in Protege

`dungeons.rdf` has all tasks complete, however because of some random incompitability issue the reasoner which is required for the DL queries does not work. `dungeons_no_rules.rdf` has all rules removed and is designed for the DL query testing. `dl_queries.txt` has some test queries.
